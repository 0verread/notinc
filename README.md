few data structure that is avilable in C++ or python but not in C (unordered_map, vector, etc). Trying to implement them in C.


> This is not production-ready code. This is for my learning purpose. I worked with C a long time ago and it was the first language I've learned and I still love it ( even in this Rust era). This is my attempt to learn C again with this small project.

- [x] bprint (*beta*) - print format string like python

- [ ] hash_map - unordered_map in C++

- [ ] arraylist - Dynamic array / vector in C++
